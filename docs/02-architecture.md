# Architecture

## Feature-Sliced Hexagonal (FSH)

This project combines three complementary architectural patterns:

| Pattern                          | What it provides                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** | Domain logic is framework-agnostic. External systems implement typed ports. Dependency inversion is enforced at the package boundary.                               |
| **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**  | Code is organised vertically by business feature, then horizontally by concern (ui / model / api). Each feature slice is self-contained and independently testable. |
| **Monorepo (Turborepo)**         | Pure domain logic lives in `packages/domain` — zero React/Next.js dependencies. A future mobile or desktop app can reuse the same domain without modification.      |

## Dependency Rule

```
shared ← entities ← features ← widgets ← pages/app
domain ← application ← infrastructure ← presentation
```

Outer layers import from inner layers. The reverse is enforced by `eslint-plugin-boundaries` — a failing lint check is a dependency violation, caught in CI before it reaches review.

### Why the `entities/` layer exists

`entities/` sits between `shared/` (no business knowledge) and `features/` (user actions). It answers the question **"what does this domain object look like?"** without answering **"what can the user do with it?"**

| Layer       | Knows about business? | Knows about user actions? | Example                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `shared/`   | No                    | No                        | `DatePicker`, `format-currency`         |
| `entities/` | Yes — passive         | No                        | `InvoiceStatusBadge`, invoice types     |
| `features/` | Yes                   | Yes                       | `useCreateInvoice`, `CreateInvoiceForm` |
| `widgets/`  | Composes both         | No direct logic           | `InvoiceTable`, `AppSidebar`            |

**Concrete example — `InvoiceStatusBadge`:**

```
❌ shared/ui/        → shared cannot have business semantics (PENDING, APPROVED are domain concepts)
❌ features/list-invoices/  → features/create-invoice and features/view-invoice also need it
                              (cross-feature import is forbidden)
❌ widgets/          → badge is an atom; widgets are large composed blocks
✅ entities/invoice/ → knows what an invoice status looks like, nothing more
```

`entities/invoice/model/` also acts as the single import gateway for domain types and API schemas — every feature imports `Invoice`, `InvoiceStatus`, and Zod schemas from `entities/invoice` rather than reaching directly into `@simpleinvoice/domain` or `@simpleinvoice/api-contracts`. This keeps package coupling centralised and refactorable in one place.

The browser only ever speaks to `*.simpleinvoice-web.vercel.app`. 101 Digital tokens are stored in `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookies — invisible to JavaScript, immune to XSS.

## Cross-Platform Business Logic

One of the core architectural benefits of this design is that **all business logic lives in `packages/domain` — a pure TypeScript package with zero framework dependencies**. This means the same validation rules, use cases, and error types can be consumed by any JavaScript runtime without modification.

```
packages/domain/          ← zero deps: no React, no Next.js, no Node APIs
      │
      ├── runs on Next.js (apps/web)          → server-side Route Handlers + RSC
      ├── runs on React Native / Expo         → apps/mobile (future)
      ├── runs on Tauri webview               → apps/desktop (future)
      └── runs on Node.js CLI / scripts       → tooling, data migrations
```

In practice this means:

- **Invoice validation rules** (required fields, date constraints, amount calculations) are written once in `packages/domain` and enforced identically on web, mobile, and desktop — no copy-paste drift.
- **Use cases** (`CreateInvoiceUseCase`, `LoginUseCase`) contain the orchestration logic. Each platform provides its own adapter (HTTP fetch, SQLite, SecureStore) but plugs into the same port interface.
- **Error types** (`InvoiceCreateError`, `InvoiceNotFoundError`) are shared, so error handling code in any app can switch on the same discriminated union.

│
├── apps/

│   │   └── src/infrastructure/
│   │       └── 101digital/
│   │           └── InvoiceAdapter.ts    # implements InvoiceRepository → fetch()
│   │
│   ├── mobile/                          # React Native / Expo (future)
│   │   └── src/infrastructure/
│   │       └── 101digital/
│   │           └── InvoiceAdapter.ts    # implements InvoiceRepository → fetch()
│   │                                    # (same port, different transport config)
│   │
│   └── desktop/                         # Tauri (future)
│       └── src/infrastructure/
│           └── InvoiceAdapter.ts        # implements InvoiceRepository → Tauri IPC
```

Each platform column is different; the domain column is identical. Adding a new business rule means editing one file in `packages/domain` — every app picks it up automatically on the next build.
